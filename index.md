### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it began to deal with unique functions and algoritims with the use of for and while loops. These loops are very simply yet they can go so far in computer science and are the bases of every algorithm. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was the creating of a basic guessing game where one player picks a number and the next player tries to guess the number. This project was really fun to make as not only was it easy to make but also it helped challenge me to make a code effecient as well as fun. It also helped bring together header files for me aswell as creating a game. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was fun to make as it was the first edition on graphics and how colors work in code. It was unique step back from all the logic based code to physical code. It also helped understand the way colors work but also when creating images the concept of pixel perfect pictures is a lot harder to create.
